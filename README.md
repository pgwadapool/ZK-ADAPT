# qLORADecentralizedML

## Overview
qLORADecentralizedML is a pioneering project that integrates Quantized Low-Rank Approximation (qLORA) with decentralized machine learning, focusing on the efficient and private training of large language models (LLM). This initiative aims to enhance computational efficiency, ensure data privacy, and facilitate secure communication in federated learning environments.

## Key Features
- **qLORA Integration:** Utilizes qLORA for optimizing neural network training, reducing computational complexity in Distributed learning.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Leverages Storj for secure, distributed storage of model weights, enhancing data privacy.
- **State Channel Communication:** Employs state channels, specifically focusing on Cardano Hydra, for efficient and secure communication among participants.
