In this simplified TLA+ specification for distributed training:

1) We define two agents, Agent1 and Agent2, each with its own model (Agent1Model and Agent2Model). The goal is for both agents to train their models to match at the end of training.

2) We have a constant MaxEpochs that defines the maximum number of training epochs.

3) The Init operator specifies the initial state of the system, where both agents start with an initial model (set to 0 in this example).

4) The Agent1Update and Agent2Update operators represent how each agent updates its model during training epochs. These are intentionally kept simple for illustration.

5) The Train operator defines the overall system behavior during training. It initializes the system, and in each epoch, both agents update their models. At the end of training, we ensure that the models of both agents match.

6) The Properties operator specifies the properties we want to check. In this case, we check if the models of Agent1 and Agent2 match at the end of training.

7) We have not considered dropout in this design
